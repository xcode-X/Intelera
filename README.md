# Intelera — Cybersecurity & Secure Web Engineering

Enterprise-level marketing site for **Intelera** (Monrovia, Liberia): cybersecurity and secure web engineering. Built to feel like a premium, custom enterprise site with strong UX and lead generation.

## Stack

- **Frontend:** React (Vite), Tailwind CSS v4, Framer Motion, React Router
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, JWT, bcrypt, Helmet, rate limiting, express-validator

## Quick start

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET, optional ADMIN_EMAIL/ADMIN_PASSWORD
npm install
npm run seed    # Create admin user (default admin@intelera.com / admin123)
npm run dev     # http://localhost:5000
```

If you see **"Failed running 'server.js'"** or **"Port 5000 is already in use"**: another process is using that port (often a previous server run). Close the other terminal, or run `netstat -ano | findstr :5000` (Windows) to find the process and stop it, or set `PORT=5001` in `server/.env` and use that port for the API.

Ensure MongoDB is running (local or set `MONGODB_URI` in `.env`).

### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev     # http://localhost:5173
```

The client proxies `/api` to the backend when running in dev.

### Seeing your changes (important)

**Your edits will only show up if you are running the frontend dev server and opening the app from it.**

1. **Run the dev server** (from project root):
   ```bash
   npm install   # once, to install concurrently
   npm run dev   # starts both client and server
   ```
   Or run client and server separately:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   cd server && npm run dev
   # Terminal 2
   cd client && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the app in your browser:**  
   **http://localhost:5173**  
   Do not open `client/dist/index.html` or a file path — that is the built output and only updates when you run `npm run build`.

3. **If changes still don’t appear:**
   - Hard refresh: **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac).
   - Or open DevTools (F12) → Network tab → check “Disable cache”, then refresh.
   - Restart the client dev server: stop it (Ctrl+C) and run `npm run dev` again from `client` (or `npm run dev` from root).

The Vite config uses file polling so edits are detected on Windows. If you were opening the built site or a different URL, switching to **http://localhost:5173** with the dev server running will show your changes.

### 3. Admin

- Open http://localhost:5173/admin
- Log in with the seed admin (e.g. `admin@intelera.com` / `admin123`)
- Manage Blog, Case Studies, Services, Contact Submissions, Users, Settings
